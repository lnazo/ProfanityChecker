    "Squanchin' party bro!"

Squanchy is a cat-like anthropomorphic creature that was invited to Rick and Summer's party in Ricksy Business. Morty and Jessica catch Squanchy engaging in auto-erotic asphyxiation masturbation in Morty's garage. He refers to this as "squanching".

In The Wedding Squanchers, after Tammy reveals herself as a deep cover agent for the Galactic Federation and the wedding reception is ambushed by Gromflomites, Squanchy tells Rick to save his family and get out of there before pulling out one of his teeth and breaking it in half to consume a green liquid substance which subsequently turns him into a giant version of himself with superhuman strength and endurance. At the end of the episode it is hinted to that Squanchy may have died in the fight against the Gromflamites when Rick drops the photo of Birdperson, Squanchy and himself.
